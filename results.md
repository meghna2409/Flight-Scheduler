Our leading question is to use the information from the OpenFlights dataset to compute the distance and find the shortest path between two cities. We were able to achieve this goal by first creating parsing and data storing abilities for the airport data and routes data from the dataset. 
Following, we are able to traverse through the graph and visit nodes using BFS and then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path given two airports.
With our project, we were able to find that the distance of the shortest path from Auckland, New Zealand to MÃ¡laga, Spain is 19968 km and the distance of the shortest path from Chicago to Bangalore, India is 13731 km.
Towards the middle of our project, we struggled with organizing our code because we did not spend enough time designing the structure at the beginning.
Therefore, if we were to do this all over again we would spend a lot more time designing where everything is supposed to go before starting to code in order to save tiem and frustration.
Furthermore, if we were given more time to work on our project, we would expand our project by finding a way to visually represent the graph data so that the shortest path of each airport from another
can easily be found and compared with each other.
