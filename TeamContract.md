# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    Our team will meet in person at 10:30 am on Mondays and Wednesdays (twice a week).  
2. **Assistance** 

    Our teammates have each other's phone numbers, so we will use that to contact each other if we need help or an opinion on a task. We expect everyone to respond within one day.
    
3. **Respect** 

    We will ensure equality and respect in our team by allowing and encouraging every person to voice their thoughts and consulting each other before making any important decisions for the project. We will also persuade a group member to share their opinion or contribute to the conversation if we realize that they have not spoken or engaged with the rest of the team in a while. 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
    
    We will assign workload by creating different issues on Github for each team member. If any of us have trouble with the code, our weekly meetings will be an opportunity to help each other overcome any roadblocks we face. For any other complications that arise, we will try to resolve it ourselves by communicating with each other and working it out.

5. **Time Commitment** 

    Each group member should contribute at least two hours per week to the project. There are currently no time commitment issues since we've scheduled to meet when everyone is free. But if we inevitably run into time conflicts in the future, we will communicate with each other to reschedule or postpone our meeting accordingly.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    Our team will resolve situations by weighing the pros and cons of various sides of the argument and making a unanimous decision based on what is best for the project. If one or more members have not accomplished their tasks or are habitually late to weekly meetings, we will reach out to them and check in with them to see if everything is okay and what the issue is. If they are not completing their assignments because they are having trouble with the code, we will work together to solve the problem. There are no other hypothetical situations our team needs to discuss ahead of team. If any issues persist after attempting to resolve them as a team, we will inform the course staff as recommended.
